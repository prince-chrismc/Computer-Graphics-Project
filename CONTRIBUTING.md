# Introduction
This project is a personal exploration. This repository is the result of all the blood, sweat and tears we put in. We ask for you to respect that.

### Why you should read these guidelines.
>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developer(s) managing and developing this private project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contributors Guidelines

### Branch Model
The `master` branch is for stable and working code that could possibly be submitted. This means any changes to `master` will not break the build or fail the behavoiral test benchmark set by the previous commit. This will require are developmental work to be done in seperate branches; *Working branches* as they will be called, will be prefixed with either `feature\` or `exploration\`. Feature branches are required work in order to obtain the goals of the project and should end their life cycle is a pull request for master. Exploration branches can fall into two categories:

- A. Attempts a new features which may not succed. Trial by error approach.
- B. New functionality which may not meet Behavoiral test criteria.

The third option for a branch prefix will be `fix\`; these branches are used to directly address issues in the code and *should* be attached to an issue. This set of branches also aims to provide a space for any work or maintaince related to the project but does not meet the intentions for either `feature\` or `exploration\`. This means that no branch should exist without a prefix.

### Commit Details
While working in the correct branch, commit message must properly describe the changes applying. *Commits should compile*; however if a sitution araises where a commit does not compile it should be prefixed with a '\*' at the beginning of the message (this is excluding `master` where all commits must meet the [requirements](#Branch-Model-and-Commit-Details) above).

### Pull Requests

These are the key for the work and development done to transition to the final product. They should be test and reviewed throughly by *atleast* one member of the team in a reasonable time frame. They should also have the correct labels attached in order to track which categories/domains of the project are showing progress.

## What kinds of contributions we are looking for

### Bug reports
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:
1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` commit in the repository.
3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experiences the
problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Contributions we are NOT looking for
> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.
